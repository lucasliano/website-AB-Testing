      About OpenRF Instruments
    </h1>
    <p class="text-gray-700 max-w-2xl">
      We are RF and microwave engineers building the instruments we wanted
      in our own labs: open, well-documented, and precise enough for serious
      work in industry and academia.

      <p>
        Our background spans RF front-end design, test instrumentation,
        and academic research. We validate performance against established
        lab equipment and document the results openly.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">Committed to open standards</h2>
      <p>
        We favor open data formats, well-defined APIs, and transparent
        measurement workflows so you are never locked into a black box.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">Long-term support</h2>
      <p>
        We actively maintain firmware, documentation, and example code, and
        use the same instruments in our own labs, ensuring issues are found
        and fixed quickly.

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Our motivation</h2>
        <p>
          High-performance RF test equipment is often closed, expensive, and
          difficult to integrate with modern software workflows. We believe
          open hardware and accessible APIs can change that without
          compromising on performance.

      <div class="rounded-xl bg-gray-50 shadow-md p-6">
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Working with universities</h2>
        <p>
          We collaborate with educators to align lab exercises with real
          course objectives and to support long-term lab deployments,
          including volume pricing and support contracts.
